# Campho Advance Dumper

This is GBA homebrew designed to dump the Campho Advance ROM. Load it onto a GBA via multiboot (e.g. using GoombaSend or another program) and run it. Data will be dumped via JoyBus. Another piece of homebrew should be used such as NINJA to capture the data. Requires DevKitPro to build.
